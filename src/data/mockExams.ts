        'True',
        'False'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: 'Agile leaders are primarily serving leaders who help their teams improve by supporting good Agile working practices and, most importantly, interceding on their behalf when they need help to remove impediments.

      question: 'Technical debt is any shortcomings in the code that makes it less than "good enough" (technical shortcuts and brittle or outdated legacy applications) that creates risks in the future. Which of the following statements is true about technical debt? (Choose the best answer)',
      options: [
        'Technical debt is a threat to the long-term viability of a product.',
        'Technical debt can be handled after delivery during the maintenance period.',
        'The amount of technical debt is a representation of the quality of the development practices.',
        'Only the developers need to be concerned with technical debt.'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation: 'Technical debt is any shortcoming in the solution that makes it less than "good enough" and might create problems in the future. Technical debt will always exist and cannot be completely eliminated as it is a natural byproduct of working in complex environments thus may not be a sign of poor practices. When there\'s a lot of technical debt, the velocity might decrease in the future because developers have to deal with the shortcomings. On the other hand, this debt might even remain in the final product and make it harder and more expensive to maintain the product. Refactoring is a common way of managing or reducing technical debt. Refactoring is when the code is improved without changing its external behavior. It\'s a good idea for Agile teams to spend some of their capacity on continuous refactoring. Improving the definition of "Done" is the another way of managing technical debt.'

      correctAnswer: 4,
      explanation: 'In Scrum, the term "Scrum Team" encompasses the Developers, Scrum Master, and Product Owner collectively. Therefore, when referring to responsibility for resolving issues related to failing to deliver shippable increments, it is the responsibility of the Scrum Team as a whole, which includes both the Developers and the Scrum Master, with support and collaboration from the Product Owner.

      correctAnswer: [0, 1, 2, 3],
      explanation: 'Complex contexts are often unpredictable, and the best approach here is to "Probe â€“ Sense â€“ Respond." Rather than trying to control the situation or insisting on a plan of action, it\'s often best to be patient, look for patterns, and encourage a solution to emerge.'

        'Remove the teams with the lowest headcount, assuming they are less valuable.'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: 'In assessing the value of Scrum Teams to reduce costs, it\'s crucial to employ metrics that objectively evaluate their performance and efficiency. The most effective approach involves analyzing quantitative measures such as throughput, cycle time, and Sprint burndown. By identifying teams with consistently lower performance or higher inefficiencies based on these metrics, informed decisions can be made regarding their removal. However, approaches based solely on headcount, seniority, qualitative factors, or project visibility may lead to inaccurate assessments and overlook the broader implications of disbanding teams. Therefore, prioritizing objective performance metrics ensures that decisions are grounded in data and aligned with organizational goals, ultimately enabling cost reduction without sacrificing productivity or effectiveness.'

      options: [
        'False',
        'True'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: 'Supporting empiricism, which is a fundamental principle of Agile methodologies, involves making decisions based on empirical evidence, observation, and experimentation rather than speculation or assumptions. One effective way to support empiricism is by delivering a solution or increment of work and gathering feedback on its performance and impact in the real world. This feedback provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the solution, identifies areas for improvement, and informs the decision-making process for determining the next best action. By embracing a cycle of delivery, feedback, and adaptation, teams can continuously improve their products or solutions and better meet the needs of their users or customers.

Product Owners should possess a clear comprehension of the product vision, roadmap, and release planning to effectively guide the Developers. Furthermore, robust communication and collaboration skills are indispensable for gathering and prioritizing requirements from stakeholders. Conversely, the incorrect answers propose qualifications that are not directly pertinent to the Product Owner role in Scrum.

      explanation: 'When addressing complex adaptive problems or products, such as those encountered in Agile and Scrum environments, the level of uncertainty is often highest at the beginning of the project.

        question: 'You are a manager at an organization that develops and provides products and services for customers. Your organization has 4 Scrum Teams. Over the past several Sprints it has come to your observation that one of the teams is only averaging 15-20 story points per Sprint whereas the other teams are averaging 30-40 story points.

Throughout this period, the team has consistently delivered working software at the end of each Sprint, albeit without releasing it to the market. However, there is now mounting pressure from internal stakeholders to push for a release within the next two months. Despite this, the Product Owner expresses reservations, deeming the proposed release premature given the substantial work required before she can confidently endorse it, estimating a timeline of at least six months for readiness. In light of these circumstances, and in adherence to Scrum principles, what guidance or support can you provide? (Choose the best two answers)',
