The Scrum Team is structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage its work. IV. The Developers work given their functional description such as analyst, developer, and tester. V.

While passive observation by stakeholders might occasionally happen, actively using the Daily Scrum as a forum for stakeholders to \"check progress\" undermines the event's purpose and can lead to micromanagement—something that is against the principles of self-management in Scrum.\n\nII- During Sprint Planning, the entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.

      "explanation": "The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically ten or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner."

Further, the Product Backlog has not changed much. Over the first three Sprints, the average velocity is fifteen, but not all the delivered functionality was tested as needed. The Developers estimate that the unfinished testing would have required 25% of a Sprint’s time. The Developers believe that the required velocity of twenty-three is within their reach.

In other words, the Increment is not releasable. They tell John their estimated effort for paying off the technical debt and suggest paying it off before proceeding with new features. The Developers also re-estimate the effort to complete the remaining Product Backlog, including testing activities.",
        "Option 2: The Developers make sure that, for the next Sprints, the selected Product Backlog items are as done as possible. In case the work for a given Sprint is not done, they add it to the next Sprint's Sprint Backlog.",

Further, to compensate for the flaws in the past Sprints, the Developers must figure out how to improve their velocity in future Sprints.

They should estimate the effort required to pay off the technical debt and suggest addressing it before proceeding with new features. The Developers should also re-estimate the effort needed to complete the remaining Product Backlog, taking into account testing activities. This approach ensures that the necessary testing is performed and the Increment is of high quality before moving forward. Finally, remember that, each Sprint, the Scrum Team should aim to get all the selected Product Backlog items to Done, and should have at least one Increment, fully conforming to the Definition of Done, developed."

I - The opportunities to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog are reduced. Re-aligning is bound to become even more difficult.  II - It becomes challenging for the Scrum Master to update the Burndown chart daily, which hinders the Scrum Master from fulfilling his/her duty of tracking the Sprint’s progress.  III - The plan for the Sprint might become inaccurate and transparency over progress toward the Sprint Goal is reduced.
