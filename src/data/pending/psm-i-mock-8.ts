      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "According to the Scrum Guide, the length of a Sprint is a fixed timebox and once established, it should remain consistent throughout the entire product development (i.e., project). The duration of a Sprint is determined based on factors such as the team's ability to create a valuable, useful Increment, risks, stakeholder availability, organizational constraints, domain complexity, product complexity, team experience, and expected Increment maturity. Changing the length of a Sprint during the project can disrupt the team's rhythm, reduce the effectiveness of Sprint Planning, and make it harder to measure progress and forecast delivery.However, this is a recommendation rather than a strict rule. Changing the Sprint length may be beneficial in certain situations, such as significant shifts in the business environment, team maturity, or changing stakeholder needs. Any decision to alter the Sprint length should be made collaboratively, considering its impact on team dynamics and overall project agility. This flexibility allows teams to adapt their process to better suit evolving requirements and project contexts."

      "explanation": "The Scrum Guide does not make any statement regarding the ease or difficulty of reorganizing organizations to support Scrum Teams. A challenge faced when adopting Scrum is moving from traditional, department-based structure to having small cross-functional teams. While Scrum promotes the use of small cross-functional teams, the process of reorganizing an organization to embrace this structure can vary in difficulty depending on various factors such as the organization's size, culture, existing hierarchy, and level of change resistance.

The goal of refinement is to ensure that the Product Backlog contains sufficient, well-defined, and actionable items that can be pulled into Sprints for development. The team should dedicate time to refinement as needed to keep the Product Backlog in a healthy state, and this may vary depending on factors such as the complexity of the product, upcoming Sprints, and changing requirements. It is an ongoing activity that takes place throughout the Sprint and is a shared responsibility of the Scrum Team."
