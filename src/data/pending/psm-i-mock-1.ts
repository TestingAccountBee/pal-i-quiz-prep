      "options": [
        "The Product Owner, through discussions with the Project Manager.",
        "The Scrum Master.",
        "The Developers, independently.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": [
        "The Developers, after having the Product Backlog items clarified by the Product Owner."
      ],
      "explanation": "The responsibility for sizing the Product Backlog Items lies with the Developers. They should engage in discussions with the Product Owner to clarify the items and gain a shared understanding. Based on their technical expertise and understanding of the work, the Developers can then determine the effort or size required for each Product Backlog Item. This helps in planning and prioritizing the work during Sprint Planning and facilitates the team's commitment to delivering the selected items within the Sprint."

        "The Developers can work more effectively with a specific and common objective."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": [
        "The Developers can work more effectively with a specific and common objective."
      ],
      "explanation": "Having a Sprint Goal provides the Developers with a clear focus and direction for their work during the Sprint. It helps them align their efforts and prioritize their tasks to achieve the defined objective. By having a Sprint Goal, the Developers can work more collaboratively and efficiently, making informed decisions about how to best deliver value and meet the goal. The Sprint Goal also serves as a guiding principle for the team's decision-making and provides a sense of purpose and coherence to their work throughout the Sprint."

        "Management is responsible for creating an environment that supports the self-managing and empowerment of the Scrum Team, such as providing resources and insights to help them improve."
      ],
      "explanation": "In Scrum, the accountability of management in relation to a Scrum Team is to create an environment that enables the team to self-manage and be empowered. This means that management should provide the necessary resources, support, and insights to help the team succeed. Instead of assigning tasks to the Developers or tracking their productivity, management focuses on enabling the team to take ownership of their work and make decisions collectively. By fostering a culture of trust and collaboration, management facilitates the team's ability to deliver value and continuously improve. Monitoring staffing levels is not the primary accountability of management in Scrum, as the team is responsible for self-managing and determining the most effective way to accomplish their work."

The length of the Sprint should allow for a meaningful cycle of work, where the team can complete, review, and reflect on their work to gather feedback and make improvements. By having a suitable Sprint duration, the team can maximize their learning, adapt their approach, and continuously improve their processes and outcomes. While factors such as the organization's policy, team member availability, and release schedules may influence the Sprint length to some extent, the primary focus should be on creating a time frame that enables effective learning and iterative development."

      ],
      "explanation": "According to the Scrum Guide, the Daily Scrum is an important event for the Developers to inspect their progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt their plan for the remainder of the Sprint. Reducing the frequency of this event could result in several negative consequences, including fewer opportunities to inspect and adapt the Sprint Backlog, an outdated Sprint Backlog, and slower identification and resolution of impediments. These issues could impact the team's ability to deliver a \"Done\" Increment that meets the Definition of Done and achieves the Sprint Goal."

      "explanation": "According to the Scrum Guide, estimates in Scrum are made by those doing the work, which in this case would be the Developers. The Developers have the best understanding of the effort and complexity involved in completing a Product Backlog item and are, therefore, best positioned to provide accurate estimates. While the Product Owner may provide input and guidance, ultimately, it is up to the Developers to estimate the work. The Scrum Master can support this process by facilitating discussions and helping the team to reach a shared understanding of the work involved."

Note that instructing the Developers to communicate using only business needs and objectives may limit the scope of their communication. Effective communication in Scrum goes beyond just conveying business needs and objectives. It involves a collaborative and iterative approach where the Developers and the Product Owner can discuss requirements, clarify doubts, provide feedback, and align their understanding of the product. By focusing solely on business needs and objectives, other important aspects of communication, such as technical considerations and implementation details, may be overlooked."
