      "options": [
        "To evaluate the Scrum Team's activities and processes during the Sprint.",
        "To review the product Increment with stakeholders and gather feedback for future work.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": [
        "To review the product Increment with stakeholders and gather feedback for future work."
      ],
      "explanation": "The purpose of a Sprint Review is to inspect the product Increment with the stakeholders and collect feedback on the next steps. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate to review what was accomplished during the Sprint and discuss what could be done in the next Sprint. This allows for transparency and helps ensure that the product is meeting the needs of the stakeholders."

      "explanation": "The Daily Scrum is started by whoever the Developers decide should start. The Daily Scrum is an event for the Developers, and they are responsible for conducting it. The Scrum Master's role is to ensure that the event takes place and stays within the timebox, but it is up to the Developers to decide how to conduct the event."

        "Create Product Backlog items for each performance concern.",
        "Include performance concerns in the Definition of Done."
      ],
      "explanation": "Two effective ways for a Scrum Team to ensure that performance concerns are satisfied are to create Product Backlog items for each concern and to add performance concerns to the Definition of Done. By creating Product Backlog items for performance concerns, the team can prioritize and plan for addressing these concerns during Sprint Planning. By adding performance concerns to the Definition of Done, the team ensures that all work meets the necessary performance standards before being considered complete."

      "correctAnswer": [
        "The Developers on the Scrum Team should write the user documentation themselves."
      ],
      "explanation": "If user documentation is part of the Definition of Done, the Developers on the Scrum Team should write the user documentation. The Scrum Team is responsible for delivering a useful, valuable Increment every Sprint, and this includes meeting all the criteria in the Definition of Done."

        "Inform the Product Owner so that the matter can be worked with the CEO"
      ],
      "explanation": "The Product Backlog is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team. Thus, a request from the CEO can not be fulfilled by the Scrum Team, if it is not a Product Backlog item. Those wanting to change the Product Backlog, including the CEO, can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner. Notice that, during the Sprint, the scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned. Thus, there are several possible scenarios here: - The request might be rejected and not added to the Product Backlog - The request might be accepted and added to the Product Backlog by the Product Owner, and considered in future Sprint Planning events by the Scrum Team - If the request is important and in line with the current Sprint Goal, the request might be accepted and added to the Product Backlog by the Product Owner and transferred to the current Sprint through discussion between the Product Owner and the Developers. - If the request is urgent and makes the Sprint Goal obsolete, the Product Owner might cancel the Sprint."

Otherwise, for example, in a project with one-week Sprints (i.e., 5 working days), you will spend 2 days, equal to 40% of the time, on meetings instead of creating the product.

The point here is to avoid behavior such as having the Developers pointing to the Product Owner if the customers are not satisfied with WHAT is being delivered and to encourage the Developers (and Scrum Master) to work with the Product Owner and help him/her defining the Product. However, in practice, if you would have to choose between the PO, Scrum Master, or Developers, who would be responsible for engaging the stakeholders? The PO, of course, because he/she is accountable for maximizing the value of the product and the Developers are busy developing the Increment. Just as an example, the Developers could proactively make \"mini-reviews\" with stakeholders during the Sprint to gather feedback on the Increments being built. This is \"stakeholder engagement\"."

Next, it's crucial that the Developers are apprised of the feedback. It might be necessary to guide the Product Owner on how to communicate this issue effectively to them to avoid any negative impact. Remember, Scrum does not identify a specific \"testers\" role. All members of the Scrum Team collaboratively work towards solving problems, including quality issues. In relation to quality concerns, these can be addressed in two ways. They can be treated as individual items on the Product Backlog, or incorporated within the Definition of Done. Lastly, it's essential to note that in Scrum, no single member is assumed to have complete knowledge to solve a complex problem. Scrum operates on a continuous process of inspection and adaptation to respond to arising issues."
